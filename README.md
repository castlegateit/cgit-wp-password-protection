# Castlegate IT WP Password Protection

This plugin provides simple password protection for staging sites. You can find the settings page in Settings > Password Protection. When active, the plugin provides three modes:

1. **Disabled:** Access to the site is not restricted.
2. **WordPress user account:** Access to the site is restricted to logged in users.
3. **Password:** Access to the site is restricted to users who enter a single, common password.

When the third (password) option is selected, users will need to re-enter the password after 24 hours.
